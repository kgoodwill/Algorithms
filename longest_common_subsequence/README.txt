To compile and run:

	g++ -std=c++0x -o program1 program1.cpp
	g++ -std=c++0x -o program2 program2.cpp
	g++ -std=c++0x -o program3 program3.cpp

Data Structures:
	Arrays and 2D arrays are used multiple times for storage of input strings and memoization

Analysis:
	Program 1: This program should run in O(mn) time, this one runs the fastest due to limited recursion overhead
	Program 2: This program should run in O(2^n) time
	Program 3: This program should run in O(mn) time

Classes:
	LCS: Contains all of the methods and data members relating to LCS
